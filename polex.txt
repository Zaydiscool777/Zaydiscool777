Polish notation
A sym(bol) is one of:
- A normal char(acter), e.g. "a", called a lit(eral)
- A symbol that doesn't take input
- A symbol and it's following inputs
# matches unicode lit from first 4 lit inputs that match "[0F"
and is considered a lit.

Primitive nonliteral characters are:
. -> matches any lit
* -> matches next sym input any amount of times
*. is special: it makes the searcher search for the rest of the expression after it.
~ -> matches anything in . but next sym input
& -> matches intersection of the next two sym inputs
] -> matches nothing (so "|]ab can match 'ab' or 'b')
# already explained
> -> matches next sym input on next character after that one that is being tested
< -> matches next sym input on previous character after that one that is being tested
( -> matches start
) -> matches end

Semi-primitive nonliteral characters are:
| -> matches intersection of the next two sym inputs ("|ab" == "~&~a~b")
[ -> matches any lit from unicode first lit input to second lit input, e.g. "[Az"
(while tedious, it can be done w/ |, which can be w/ ~ and &.
e.g. "[0F" becomes "|||01|23|45|67|89|AB|CD|EF", which becomes, uh...)
{} is special: it takes in a hex number BETWEEN { and } and repeats the next sym that many times,
as if it was replaced inside of the expression.
e.g. {A}
\ -> escapes the characters ".*~&[]()<>{}|\" ("\\" == "#005C")
\t, \n, \v and \r also work, but can also be interpreted literally in polex.
