I was going to remove the "g" (you know, rhyming?), but I saw an xkcd comic beforehand and I knew it would be a mistake.
so i will name it clogit because it's clgit and it uses o a lot

this is how it will look:

oooov--o*-o+-+ov--++*o
    \oo--*-^o/ \v-|/
                \o/

key:
- -> nothing (activity is having elsewhere)
o -> commit/normal
* -> special commit/special
eg: push local, push fork (or > ?), rebase (or 0 ?)
possible: pull fork (or < ?)
v ^ -> branch/split
\ / -> merge in a moving way (the branch that is merging)
+ -> merge in a merging way (the branch to be merged with)
| -> merge going across this branch (not like it's 3d) (always goes with '/' / '\')

pressing the left and right kets will highlight different non-'-|' symbols via ansi color
and shows info under it using ~~~~~~~~~~~s

future's future: add spaced by time: all - if nothing happens, and all ? if more than 1 thing happens
